    "### Why use hash tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables allow us to look up data in constant time, O(1), by reserving a specified number of locations in memory and storing data based on a memory address (or index) that is generated from a key value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of generating an index from a key is called hashing. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we apply some hash function to our key to generate a number and then we assign a memory address based on that hash value. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is often done by performing a modulo operation on the hash value - that is the remainder when dividing the hash value by the number of available memory locations. This ensures that the address is within the range of the available memory slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "When more than one unique key generates the same memory address this is called a collision and we will need to find an alternative memory location for the new key (\"open addressing\") or find a way to store multiple keys at the one location in a separate data structure (\"closed addressing\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will use an open addressing solution called \"linear probing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries are hash tables\n",
